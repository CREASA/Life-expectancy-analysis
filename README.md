# Life-expectancy-analysis
Our project has a total of six coding files (including test files). Also, we include the four raw datasets and one small test dataset. Open the "Code Modules and Datasets" folder with the python runner.

file1.py: Data cleaning module

Make sure you have Python 3.9 and the pandas module installed. If you don't have pandas installed, you can install it by running the following command in a terminal or at a command prompt.

pip install pandas

After you run the code,you can see the new file called "clean_data.csv" on your EXPLORER, if you use the Visual Studio Code.

file2.py: Data distribution analysis module

Make sure you have Python 3.9 installed and the necessary modules: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. If you do not have these modules installed, you can install them by running the following command in the terminal or at the command prompt.

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy

After you run the code, you can see the graphs in the new web page.

file3.py: Linear regression model

Make sure you have Python 3.9 and Install the required libraries using pip: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, sklearn.

After you run the code, the two functions in the file will run in the following order: P1_Model(data), P2_Model(new_gdp). All the output results are printed on the terminal.

file4.py: Decision tree model

Make sure you have Python 3.9 and Install the required libraries using pip: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, graphviz, scikit-learn.

Note that the graphviz library requires Graphviz to be installed on your computer. You can download it from https://graphviz.org/download/ and install it before running the project.ï¼ˆChoose the appropriate download option based on your operating system. For example, if you are using Windows, click on the "Windows" link to download the Windows installer.) After installation, make sure to add the Graphviz bin folder to your system's PATH environment variable so that you can use the Graphviz tools from the command line. Open a terminal or command prompt and type "pip install Graphviz". If the installation was successful, you should see the version number of the Graphviz tools.

After you run the code, you can see the decision tree graph, "feature_importance" graph, the decision tree graph, and "max_depth" graph on your EXPLORER, if you use the Visual Studio Code.

file5.py: Data visualization

Make sure you have Python 3.9 installed and the necessary modules: pandas, plotly, seaborn, and matplotlib. If you do not have these modules installed, you can install them by running the following command in the terminal or at the command prompt.

pip install pandas plotly seaborn matplotlib

After you run the code, you can see the graphs in the new web page.

file6.py: Test files

You do not need to add additional libraries for this, if you follow the above guidelines for a complete installation.

After you run the code, you can see the graphs in the new web page.
